RegionUpdater
=============

==> What does this plugin do?
Generates javascript files and provides helper for automatically updating select fields for
regions/states/provinces when specific countries are selected.

eg. If USA is selected, the label changes to "state", and the sub choices for regions become 
	"New York, Florida, California, etc."

	If Canada is selected, the label changes to "province", and the sub choices for regions
	become "British Columbia, Ontario, etc."

==> Requirements
1) Ruby on Rails 2.1 (tested on version 2.1, may work with prior versions)
2) Prototype 1.6 javascript framework


Usage
=====

If you want to customize the country and region files, go to the directory:
/vendor/plugins/region_updater/generators/region_updater/countries
and copy the file default.yaml to custom.yaml.

Edit the custom.yaml file. It is in YAML format. For an example entry of a country

	Canada:
    	label: province
    	regions:
        	- Alberta
        	- British Columbia
        	- Saskatchewan
        	- Ontario
        	- Prince Edward Island

The plugin generator will generate a javascript variable from this and WILL NOT automatically 
sort the list of regions to alphabetical order. You must do this yourself when you enter the 
regions. This is so that you have greater control of which choices will show first regardless 
of alphabetical sorting.

==> To install
1) 

2) Edit custom.yaml (see above instructions) if you want to customize the choices of the
regions. Otherwise skip to the next step.

3) Go to your rails app directory:

For the default country region choices type:
	script/generate region_updater

For the custom country region choices (assuming you've edited the custom.yaml file):
	script/generate region_updater --custom

4) Include the javascript in your app.
There are two javascript files you need to include:
- region_updater.js
- region_updater_countries.js

eg. <%= javascript_include_tag :all %>	in your layout files

5) To use the helpers.

Please refer to code for options

region_country_select
region_country_select_tag
region_update_label
region_update_select
region_update_select_tag
